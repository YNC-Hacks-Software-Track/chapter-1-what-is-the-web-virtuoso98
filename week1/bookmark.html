        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring software engineer with interests in machine learning and web development. While I do not really know where
            I'm headed, I'm trying to explore and see where my future experiences take me. 
        </p>

        <h2>Anything professionally related to you?</h2>
        <p>Well, I do have a <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhaooo/">linkedin</a>. However,  this redirects from the same link. 
        If you want my github that redirects to another link, here it is: <a href = "https://github.com/virtuoso98" target = "_blank">
            see me github</a>.</p>

        <h2>What do you do in your free time?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Anime</li>
            <li>Run</li>
            <li>Meet people and chill</li>
            <li>Leetcode</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>If you had the chance to survey someone, what are the questions you'd ask?</h2> 
        Here are a bucket list of things I'd ask:
        <ul>
            <li>How old are you?</li>
            <li>Any dietary restrictions?</li>
            <li>Tell me a little more about yourself</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If I manifest this in a form format, I think it'd look like this:</p>
        <h2>Tell me more about yourself!</h2>
        <form>
            <label for = "age">Select your age: </label>
            <select name = "age" id = "age">
                <option value = "0-20">0 - 20</option>
                <option value = "20-30">20-30</option>
                <option value = "30-40">30-40</option>
                <option value = "40-50">40-50</option>
                <option value = "50-60">50-60</option>
                <option value = ">60">>60</option>
            </select><br>

            <label for = "restriction">Tell me your dietary restrictions</label>
            <input type = "radio" id = "None" name = "restriction" value = "None">
            <label for = "None">None</label><br>
            <input type = "radio" id = "Vegetarian" name = "restriction" value = "Vegetarian">
            <label for = "Vegetarian">Vegetarian</label><br>
            <input type = "radio" id = "Vegan" name = "restriction" value = "Vegan">
            <label for = "Vegan">Vegan</label><br>
            <input type = "radio" id = "Grass" name = "restriction" value = "Grass">
            <label for = "Grass"></label>Grass<br>
